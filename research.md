### Monolithically Integrated Solar Flow Battery

Integrated solar flow batteries (SFBs) are a new type of devices that integrate solar energy conversion and electrochemical storage. In SFBs, the solar energy absorbed by photoelectrodes is converted into chemical energy by charging up redox couples dissolved in electrolyte solutions in contact with the photoelectrodes. To deliver electricity on demand, the reverse redox reactions are carried out to release chemical energy stored in redox couples as one would do in the discharge of a normal redox flow battery (RFB). The integrated design of SFBs enables all the functions demanded by round trip solar energy utilization systems to be realized within a single device. 

### Single-molecule catalysis

Develop and apply single-molecule methods to study the catalytic, electrocatalytic, and photoelectrocatalytic properties of  materials.
