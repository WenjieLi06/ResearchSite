## Monolithically Integrated Solar Flow Battery

Due to the intermittent nature of sunlight, practical round-trip solar energy utilization systems require both efficient solar energy conversion and inexpensive large-scale energy storage. Conventional round-trip solar energy utilization systems typically rely on the combination of two or more separated devices to fulfill such requirement. Integrated solar flow batteries (SFBs) are a new type of devices that integrate solar energy conversion and electrochemical storage. In SFBs, the solar energy absorbed by photoelectrodes is converted into chemical energy by charging up redox couples dissolved in electrolyte solutions in contact with the photoelectrodes. To deliver electricity on demand, the reverse redox reactions are carried out to release chemical energy stored in redox couples as one would do in the discharge of a normal redox flow battery (RFB). The integrated design of SFBs enables all the functions demanded by round trip solar energy utilization systems to be realized within a single device. Leveraging rapidly developing parallel technologies of photovoltaic solar cells and RFBs, significant progress in the field of SFBs has been made in the last few years.
